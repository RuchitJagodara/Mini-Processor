# Mini-Processor

In everyday life, we use computers but as we know its computing power depends mainly on the processor, many times we heard from people that if you have a good processor, then your machine does not hang, or if you have a good processor, then you can play games without any problem in your machine. So, to understand how these processors work, my friend Hitesh and I made a mini-processor whose code and results are included in this repo.


# Overview of this project

As we know, real processors have many basic operations, but as we wanted to just understand the working of processor, we have implemented very basic operations on it.
